Twitter's quick test: 
To run the twitter file, please bundle and visit localhost:3000. A json object rendering the total number of words counted will be available, as well as the 10 most frequently tweeted words. Only five minutes worth of tweets were gathered via Twitter's streaming sample api. The full set of original words can be found in a text file in public. All modules can be found in lib. 

Factors and caching: 
The second challenge was completed using javascript. All logic is commented within the file.
